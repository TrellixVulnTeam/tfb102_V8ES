Huge 420-million-year-old fish species rediscovered in Indian Ocean

4.完整新聞內文:
A humongous "fossil fish" with origins that can be traced back 420 million
years has resurfaced in the West Indian Ocean off the coast of Madagascar.

The 6.5-feet, up to 198-pound coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) was believed
to have gone extinct at least a century ago. However, a recent study
published in the SA Journal of Science revealed that as of May 2020 as many
as 334 coelacanth captures had been documented.

The coelacanth species, also known as the "four-legged fish" for its vigorous
fins, roams in deep undersea canyons between 350 and 1,600 feet below the
surface.

According to the Smithsonian Ocean Portal, the fish were first rediscovered
in 1938 using gill-nets.

The species was named for its discoverer, Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, and
reportedly described by Rhodes University's Professor J.L.B. Smith in 1939.

It can weigh up to 200 pounds, according to the non-profit conservation and
environmental science news platform Mongabay.

In an interview, the study's lead author said he and his researchers were
shocked by the number of coelacanths caught as by-catch in large-mesh
gill-nets known as "jarifa."

The study also presented a case for conservation – although the species'
population size remains unknown – and noted the negative effects of gill-net
fishing in the shark-fin trade.

"The jarifa gill-nets used to catch sharks are a relatively new and more
deadly innovation as they are large and can be set in deep water,"
researchers said. "There is little doubt that large mesh jarifa gill-nets are
now the biggest threat to the survival of coelacanths in Madagascar."

本來大家覺得絕種的腔棘魚
突然又被找到 但是只有少數幾條
結果根據南非科學期刊(SA)
約334隻腔棘魚生活在350~1600呎印度洋底下


腔棘魚們你以為你們逃的了R
